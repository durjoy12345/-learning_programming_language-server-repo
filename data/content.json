    "details": "Indeed, C++ is one of the most recommended and widely used programming languages for Competitive Programming. C++, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, is a relatively faster programming language in comparison to various other renowned languages. Meanwhile, as the execution time plays a crucial role in Competitive Programming, hence C++ is the most preferred language by the programmers. The general-purpose programming language consists of a rich library known as Standard Template Library that makes it easier for the programmers to do efficient & effective programming. The Standard Template Library includes C++ template classes that offer various data structures such as lists, trees, stacks, graphs, arrays, etc. Moreover, the language supports OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming) features as well to help you out while solving real-time problems in coding challenges."

    "details": "How to Improve Communication Skills  (Major Updates Coming Soon!) Do you struggle with getting your words out when explaining things in important situations, situations like interviews, presentations, meetings, phone or video conferences?  Do you become anxious, nervous tense up, loose track of where you're at, speak too fast, or even stutter?  Do people sometimes have trouble understanding you because English is your second language? If you answered yes to any of the above, relax…help is finally here!  My name is Michael Williams and I stuttered for over 20 years.  For the past two decades I've made my living speaking.  I teach academic success as a professor, have conducted day-long and multi-day relationship and communication retreats, taught in churches, spoke on live T.V., radio and much more.  I've even taught small classes in Spanish.  I now work with people from all around the world helping them learn to speak more smoothly, fluently, clearly and confidently.  I call this type of speech Proactive. Eventually, I created a step-by-step process for becoming a Proactive Speaker and I call this the PR90D Speech System.  If you struggle with speaking well, this course can literally transform your life.  You probably know from personal experience that not being able to speak well can limit your career choices, restrict your social life, and restrict your relationships.  I've worked with people who could not get jobs, or who were being paid up to 30% less because of their speech.  These were brilliantly intelligent people, but because of speech limitations, they were not able to express themselves the way they wanted. If you're willing to put in the time and work, the information in this course will transform your life.  If you're not, do not waste your time taking it.  While the information may be great, it will do you no good if you don't practice using it.  Also, be willing to take however, long it takes to get the results you want.  This is not a quick fix.  Certainly, you may see amazingly fast results, but don't be disappointed and give it if this doesn't happen.  Expect that this will take longer than you expect and be more difficult that you anticipate.  The time will pass anyway, so the only question is, will you be doing something to make positive changes while the time is passing? This course contains over 16 transformative sessions (over 3 hours of instruction).  Michael will demonstrate exactly what you need to do to accomplish the goals laid out in this course.  If you follow his instructions, you will see results. "

    "details": "On Thursday night’s episode of Up Late, Ben Harvey has suggested Troy Mercanti start an OnlyFans account if he wishes to challenge anti-consorting laws. The notorious bikie will fight allegations that he broke WA’s stringent anti-consorting and insignia laws — but is also watching a High Court challenge to the regulations which the State Government have touted have the nation’s toughest against outlaw motorcycle gang members. The long-time one per center was not in court on Wednesday when the not guilty pleas were entered. WATCH UP LATE IN THE VIDEO PLAYER ABOVE But his lawyer Paul Holmes was, who revealed that Mercanti’s defence will be on two fronts — against elements of the alleged offence, and the legislation itself. Mercanti was charged with the two offences outside an Italian restaurant in front of shocked onlookers earlier this year. According to eyewitnesses, Mercanti — dressed in a T-shirt and shorts — was having lunch with long-time friend John Kizon at Mt Hawthorn’s Lupo Lab when more than a dozen officers from the gang crime squad descended and asked him to step outside. Soon afterwards, he was told he was being charged via summons with displaying gang insignia, which was prohibited under sweeping laws that came into effect a few months ago. Earlier the same week, Mercanti was hit with a dispersal notice by police while picking up a friend at the airport. Mercanti’s case was adjourned until October to be allocated a trial date. On Up Late, Harvey warned fighting in court may get expensive for Mercanti, and suggested a way he may be able to come up with the cash. Harvey may have gotten the idea after it was this week revealed that Dhakota Williams — the 21-year-old daughter of slain underworld king Carl Williams started an OnlyFans account. “If it’s good enough for the wife and daughter of slain gangland boss Carl Williams then it’s gotta be good enough for Troy Mercanti,” Harvey says. “See Troy’s OnlyFans page for exclusive tips for how a modern outlaw can best accessorise… find out why black and white are the only colours you need in your wardrobe… a showcase of latest leather trends… tips on keeping healthy. “And exclusively for OnlyFans subscribers... an inside look at the man who put the soft into soft serve, how he relaxes listing to 80s glam-rock and some cosplay as a Lego spaceman.”"

A programs efficiency, i.e, the computation of required information fast enough, is an integral part of a programs usability. If it took two days for an algorithm designed for forecasting tomorrows weather run, the results wouldn't be very useful! Similarly, a user viewing a TVs program guide won't get any use out of it, if the tv-shows info only loads after the show already ended. In a more general sense, retrieving and displaying information quickly is an integral part of any applications function. Next let's explore algorithms associated with retrieving and sorting information. While the following examples utilize arrays, the algorithms shown will also work with other data-structures meant for storing information, such as lists."

    "details": "While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make i interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station. Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP)."

    "details": "Associated Press  Six months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that he is sending $2.98 billion in new military aid to Ukraine that will provide longer-term weapons and training to enable forces there to fight for years to come. In a statement, Biden said the aid will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, drones and other equipment 'to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term.' The announcement comes as Ukraine is celebrating its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union."

    "details": "Python gives you numerous reasons to pick it up for your next Competitive Programming contest. The high-level programming language is quite easy to learn and implement with having a very simple syntax. Moreover, the language has an extensive library & function support which somehow increases the efficiency of programmers in coding competitions. Furthermore, the language has several other worthwhile features as well such as no limit on the integer value, functions can return more than one value, code indentation, robust input statements, flexible number of arguments to a function, etc. makes Python a suitable language for Competitive Programming. Also, the language has wide use in various trending domains such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and many more."
